## How it works

A Mealy machine is a type of finite state machine where the output is determined by both the current state and the current input.

## How to test

A Mealy machine works by producing outputs that depend on both the current state and the current input. To check if it's working correctly, you need to verify that its outputs change according to this principle when different inputs are applied while the machine is in different states. This can be done by observing the state transitions and corresponding outputs based on a state diagram or transition table.
